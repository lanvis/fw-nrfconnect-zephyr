Silicon Labs Gecko HAL
######################

Origin:
   Silicon Labs Gecko SDK
   https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK

Version:
   v5.1.2

Purpose:
   Add support for Silicon Labs EXX32 SoCs

Description:
   This code component is used to add Zephyr support for Silicon Labs EXX32 SoCs.
   To speed up the development process it is based on the Silicon Labs HAL.

   The Silicon Labs HAL is split into SoC specific folders. They share the 
   Peripheral Support library.

   The following folders are imported:
   platform/Device/SiliconLabs/$(GECKO_DEVICE)
   platform/emlib

Dependencies:
   This source code depends on headers and sources from Zephyr:
   ext/hal/cmsis

How to update
+++++++++++++

  * Downloaded current version from https://github.com/SiliconLabs/Gecko_SDK
  * Extract
  * Replace the necessary files in ext/hal/silabs/gecko/Device and ext/hal/silabs/gecko/emlib
  * Ensure that the CMakeLists and Kconfig files match the new version of the Gecko SDK

The following folders are used in this HAL:

+-------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Gecko SDK         | Zephyr                      | Comments                                                           |
+-------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| platform/Device/  | ext/hal/silabs/gecko/Device | Contains the device specific files in SiliconLabs/$(GECKO_DEVICE). |
|                   |                             | The files are not modified.                                        |
+-------------------+-----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| platform/emlib/   | ext/hal/silabs/gecko/emlib  | Contains the Silabs Peripheral Support library for the EXX32 SoCs. |
|                   |                             | All files are copied over. The files are not modified.             |
